# StakeMe Smart Contract

## Overview

StakeMe is a Solidity smart contract designed for staking ERC-20 tokens. Users can stake their tokens into the contract, check their staked amount, and withdraw their staked tokens when needed.

## Contract Details

- **Dependencies:** The contract relies on an external ERC-20 token contract through the `IStandardToken` interface.

- **Structs:** It uses the `User` struct to store user staking information.

- **Events:** The `Staked` event logs staking activity.

- **State Variables:** It includes the `standardToken` variable, representing the ERC-20 token used for staking.

- **Functions:** Key functions include staking, checking staked amounts, and withdrawing.

## Getting Started

To use the StakeMe smart contract, you'll need:

1. An Ethereum development environment.

2. Access to an ERC-20 token contract or a compatible token implementing the `IStandardToken` interface.

3. Sufficient Ether for gas fees.

## Usage

1. Deploy the StakeMe contract, providing the ERC-20 token contract address.

2. Users stake tokens, check balances, and withdraw as needed.
